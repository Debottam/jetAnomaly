# jetAnomaly
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for anomalous jet tagging.
By taking in low-level jet constituentsâ€™ information, and only training with background jets in an
unsupervised manner, the VAE is able to encode important information for reconstructing jets,
while learning an expressive posterior distribution in the latent space.
